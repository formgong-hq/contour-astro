## Features

- One-page, responsive, fonts bundled (no Google Fonts requests)
- Contact form that works without a server, powered by [Formgong](https://formgong.com/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=template&utm_campaign=contour-astro&utm_content=features), a free form backend
- Spam protection (honeypot), success/error states from the real server answer
- Privacy page included · MIT licensed

## Quick start

```sh
npm install
npm run dev     # http://localhost:4321
npm run build   # static site in dist/
```

## Contact form via Formgong

The form posts straight to `https://formgong.com/submit`; no backend, no PHP, no serverless function.


1. Create a form at https://formgong.com/new and copy its access key.
2. Open `src/content.json` and replace `fk_your_access_key` (under `form.access_key`) with that key. Every text of the page lives in the same file.
3. The form sends `access_key`, `subject`, `botcheck`, `name`, `email`, `company`, `budget`, `message`. The page shows thanks only when Formgong answers `success: true`.

Submissions arrive by email (and optionally Telegram, Slack or Discord). Formgong has a free plan: [create a free form](https://formgong.com/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=template&utm_campaign=contour-astro&utm_content=form-setup).

## Deploy

Build command: `npm run build` · Output directory: `dist`. Works on Netlify, Vercel, Cloudflare and any static host.
